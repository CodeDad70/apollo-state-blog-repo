## What Is This?

This is a starter project that makes it easy to whip up a React project that has Apollo local state management working out of the box
The demo app already contains a single query and mutation. The repo has been structured to scale should your project become larger.

An accompanying blog post can be found here (todo: create/insert blogpost)

## The Technology Used

This app uses React/Apollo (Client-side).

Note that this application doesn't need to connect to a backend, nor does it connect with a database to make external queries.
This repo was created solely to manage local state with Apollo as opposed to Redux. The application is bundled using Parcel and can be set up by doing the following:

```javascript
> yarn
> yarn dev
```

Sass is the tech of choice for the CSS preprocessing which works out of the box.
